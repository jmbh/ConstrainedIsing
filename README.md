## Estimate Constrained Ising Models

Code to estimate the Ising model with constraints on thresholds and/or interaction parameters.

Files in repo:

- `IsingNegLogLik.R` Computing the negative log likelihood for the Ising Model
- `OptimConstrIsing.R` Calling optim() with data, constraints, and NegLogLik function
- `Test.R` Illustration
